# Personal Website v1

This is [version 1](https://v1.jessicawentling.com) of my personal website.

## Technologies used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- VSCode
- GitHub

I apply HTML, CSS, and JavaScript - I use some css variables <3, media query, flexbox <3, and simple JavaScript (eventListeners and such).
I've learned about some of the different browser capabilities, utilized tools to check site speed, HTML validation, social media meta tags, accessibility with the code and design, and had more practice on refactoring and bebugging.
There were some things I would have liked to include, but did not quite finish - wanted to have a button to switch over to light theme and set up a custom 404 page. I might still do these two. We will see!

Check out [version 2](https://jessicawentling.com) of my personal site where I upgrade [version 1](https://v1.jessicawentling.com) to a custom built WordPress theme. I built a plugin, custom blocks, live search function, and a blog!
